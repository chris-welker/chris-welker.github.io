Welcome! I am currently a PhD Candidate working with [**Thalia Wheatley**](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/thalia-wheatley) in the [**Dartmouth Social Systems Lab**](https://wheatlab.com). Before graduate school, I received my B.A. in Psychology with honors from Cornell. While there, I worked with [**Jesse Walker**](https://fisher.osu.edu/people/walker.2320) and [**Tom Gilovich**](https://www.thomasgilovich.com/).

My research focuses on the complex interpersonal dynamics underlying conversation and social interaction.
