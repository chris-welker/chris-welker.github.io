Welcome! I am currently a Post-Doctoral Research Associate in the [**Emotion and Behavior Lab**](https://emotionbehavior.com/) working with [**Adrienne Wood**](https://psychology.as.virginia.edu/people/adrienne-wood). Previously, I earned my PhD with [**Thalia Wheatley**](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/thalia-wheatley) in the [**Dartmouth Social Systems Lab**](https://wheatlab.com). Before graduate school, I received my B.A. in Psychology with honors from Cornell. While there, I worked with [**Jesse Walker**](https://fisher.osu.edu/people/walker.2320) and [**Tom Gilovich**](https://www.thomasgilovich.com/).

My research focuses on the complex interpersonal dynamics underlying conversation and social interaction.
