Welcome! I am currently a PhD Candidate working with [**Thalia Wheatley**](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/thalia-wheatley) in the [**Dartmouth Social Systems Lab**](https://wheatlab.com). Before graduate school, I received my B.A. in Psychology with honors from Cornell. While there, I worked with [**Jesse Walker**](https://fisher.osu.edu/people/walker.2320) and [**Tom Gilovich**](https://www.thomasgilovich.com/).

My research focuses the complex interpersonal dynamics underlying conversation and social interaction. Head over to the [**Publications**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link publications.md %}) tab to learn about my published projects and the [**Research**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link research.md %}) tab to learn about my current interests. 

<!---
When I'm not in the lab, you can usually find me outside. And when I'm outside, you can usually find me running. Check out the [**Running**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link running.md %}) tab to learn more about that corner of my life.
